# Shadow-MSC
Shadow Mission Script Compiler is a super basic (and I mean basic!) mission script compiler for use with GTA: VC.

## About
As a dev that mainly uses a MacBook for development, there currently aren't that much GTA Modding tools available that run on my preferred platform.
For my side project [OASE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOxyV5A-M9P38WibzT8wnz0Teq9oMzqbU) I often find myself writing simple scripts to test certain opcode implementations. Switching between my desktop and MacBook just to compile a script became a hassle so I finally decided to write a super simple cross platform compiler.

## Disclaimer
This tool is purely written for my personal needs and will never be as advanced as any of the other tools/compilers available.

## Known issues
- No support for threads except the main script
- No support for mission scripts
- No support for objects
- No support for local variables

Yep it's pretty useless right now!
